        <h2>Celebrate the start of the 2025 baseball season!</h2>
        <p>Practically a holiday in Charm City, Opening Day at Camden Yards celebrates the start of baseball season
            in
            Baltimore. While there’s nothing like a game at historic Oriole Park, one of the most revered baseball
            stadiums in the country, it’s just as fun to cheer on the Birds from beloved sports bars like Pickles
            Pub
            and Pratt Street Ale House. Nearby Federal Hill will also be flooded with fans, who will paint the
            streets
            black and orange for the day. However you choose to celebrate, you won’t want to miss out on this fun
            tradition!</p>

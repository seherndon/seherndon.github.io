<h1>The Daily Loaf</h1>
opened in 2022 when former food journalist Sarah Rae traded her press pass for a baker's apron.
After years of covering restaurant openings and food trends for the Baltimore Sun, Sarah realized her true passion was
creating the stories herself—one loaf at a time.</p>
<p>Located just off the Thames Street in Fell's Point, The Daily Loaf brings together Sarah's two loves: storytelling
    and sourdough. Every morning, we "publish" fresh batches of artisan breads and pastries using traditional techniques
    and local ingredients. Just like a great news story, our baking is honest, crafted with care, and meant to be
    shared.</p>
<p>Whether you're a student pulling an all-nighter or a professional preparing for morning calls, The Daily Loaf is your
    daily source for fresh-baked goodness.</p>
